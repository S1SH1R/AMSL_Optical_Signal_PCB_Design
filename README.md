# AMSL_Optical_Signal_PCB_Design
This is an exercise in basic analogue electronic circuit design using discrete components and operational amplifiers. The exercise involves designing analogue circuits for the implementation of an end-to-end optical signal transmission through free-space and a guided optical fibre channel. A lot of this is based on what we studied in Analogue Circuits 2 and 3 the last two years while also learning some things about visible light communication.
