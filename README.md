# AMSL_Optical_Signal_PCB_Design
This course is a laboratory exercise in basic analogue electronic circuit design using discrete components and operational amplifiers. The exercise involves designing analogue circuits for the implementation of an end-to-end optical signal transmission through free-space and a guided optical fibre channel.
